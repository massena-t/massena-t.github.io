    <h4>Turbo-Muon: Accelerating Orthogonality-Based Optimization with Pre-Conditioning <span class="pub-venue">Pre-print</span></h4>
    <p class="pub-authors">T. Boissin*, <em>T. Massena*</em>, F. Mamalet, M. Serrurier</p>
    <p class="pub-desc">We improve the efficiency of the costly Newton-Schulz iteration of the Muon optimizer by using a preconditioning method from the Approximately Orthogonal Layer paper from Prach et al. This allows us to conserve the impressive performance of the Muon optimizer while gaining substantial computational efficiency at scale.</p>

    <h4>Fast and Flexible Robustness Certificates for Semantic Segmentation <span class="pub-venue">Pre-print</span></h4>
    <p class="pub-authors"><em>T. Massena</em>, C. Friedrich, F. Mamalet, M. Serrurier</p>
    <p class="pub-desc">We use Lipschitz neural networks to perform certifiably robust segmentation tasks on challenging datasets such as CityScapes. Our networks are approximately 600 to 2000 times more computationally efficient at inference time. We additionally develop a full framework for the certification of complex deep learning models under arbitrary threats under two different paradigms.</p>

    <h4>Efficient Robust Conformal Prediction via Lipschitz-Bounded Networks <span class="pub-venue">ICML 2025</span></h4>
    <p class="pub-authors"><em>T. Massena*</em>, L. Andeol*, T. Boissin, F. Mamalet, C. Friedrich, M. Serrurier, S. Gerchinovitz</p>
    <p class="pub-desc">We provide a method to enable ~1000x more memory efficient Robust Conformal Prediction compared to related works without any performance loss. This enables efficient prediction with guaranteed error rates in noisy or adversarial environments.</p>

    <h4>DP-SGD without Clipping: The Lipschitz Neural Network Way <span class="pub-venue">ICLR 2024</span></h4>

    <p class="pub-desc">We show that Lipschitz-constrained neural networks allow fast and intuitive Differentially Private training, reducing DP-SGD training time significantly and eliminating detrimental clipping bias.</p>
