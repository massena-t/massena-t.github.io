## About Me

I'm Thomas Massena, a PhD student at IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse) and SNCF.

My research focuses on **trustworthy and certifiably robust methods** for machine learning, with a particular emphasis on computer vision tasks. I work on developing neural networks with provable guarantees, including Lipschitz-constrained architectures for differential privacy and robust conformal prediction.

## Research Interests

- Certifiable robustness in deep learning
- Differential privacy for neural networks
- Conformal prediction and uncertainty quantification
- Lipschitz-constrained neural networks
